        2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014
        by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli,
        in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on
        grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.
        It is a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the
        Threes app released a month earlier. Cirulli created the game in a single weekend
        as a test to see if he could program a game from scratch, describing it as a clone of
        Veewo Studios app 1024 and getting the idea from Sami Romdhanas clone 2048,
        and was surprised when his game received over 4 million visitors in less than a week,
        especially since it was just a weekend project.
        It was a way to pass the time, he said.
        The game is free to play, Cirulli having said that he was unwilling to make money from something that didnâ€™t invent.
        He released a free app version of the game for iOS and Android in May 2014.
